Example:  sicsim>hi

cat | cmp | copy | d[ir] | du[mp] | echo | e[dit] | f[ill] | head | h[elp] | hi[story] | opcode | opcodelist | q[uit] | reset | touch
  (required) Specifies the command that simulator should do

  	cat [filename(s)]
	- display file's contents. If filename does not entered, standard input will
	  be used for getting contents. If more than one filenames were given, shell will
	  display only 'exist' file's contents.
	* CAUTION *
	* 'cat' command classify filenames by 'INDENT' not 'comma'
	* If standard input is used for getting contents, 'ctrl+c' will let you get out of shell
	cmp filename1 filename2
	- compare two files. If two files are different, it will show you where the first
   	  difference is found at. If two files are same, nothing happens.
	* CAUTION *
	* 'cmp' command classify two filenames by 'INDENT' not 'comma'
	copy filename1 filename2
	- copy one file to other. When 'filename2' is already exists, this command will overlap that
	  file with 'filename1''s content.
	* CAUTION *
	* 'copy' command classify two filenames by 'INDENT' not 'comma'
        d[ir] 
	- shows items in current directory. Directory will be followed by '/', 
	  and executable file will be followed by '*'
        du[mp] [start, end] 
	- display memory. It allows set display range that you want to show
	  If you don't pass any parameters, simulator will only show 160 memory cells
	echo [message]
	- print what user entered. When no message have entered, empty line will be printed
	e[dit] address, value 
	- edit memory at (address) as (value)
	f[ill] start, end, value 
	- fill memory from (start) to (end) with (value)
	head lines filename
	- shows file's contents n-line. Lines will be counted from the very first of file.
	  If given n is bigger than total lines in file, this will show every contents
	  of file.
	* CAUTION *
	* 'head' command classify two arguments by 'INDENT' not 'comma'
	* this command will preceive given number as 'HEXADECIMAL'
	h[elp] 
	- display commands that you can use
	hi[story] 
	- display commands that successfully executed before
	opcode mnemonic 
	- let you know the opcode of given (mnemonic)
	opcodelist 
	- display instructions with <mnemonic, opcode> pair, in hash table shape
	q[uit] 
	- terminates simulator
	reset 
	- reset all memory cell as 0
	touch filename(s)
	- create new file(s) with 0-byte
	* CAUTION *
	* 'touch' command classify two filenames by 'INDENT' not 'comma'
